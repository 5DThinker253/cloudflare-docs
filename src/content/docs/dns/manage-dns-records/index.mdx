DNS records help communicate information about your domain to visitors and other web services.

Free zones created on or after `2024-09-01 00:00:00 UTC` have a limit of 200 DNS records. Free zones created before `2024-09-01 00:00:00 UTC` have a limit of 1,000 DNS records.

Pro, Business, and Enterprise have a limit of 3,500 DNS records.

If you are an Enterprise customer and require more DNS records, contact your account team. Cloudflare can support millions of DNS records on a single zone.
